HERO IMAGE CONCEPT FOR AWARDBENCH

Design Brief:
Create a sophisticated, minimalist hero image for AwardBench - the definitive government contracting AI performance benchmark. The image should embody the Apple/OpenAI design aesthetic with clean lines, generous whitespace, and subtle depth.

Visual Elements:
1. Abstract visualization of AI neural networks or data flows
2. Subtle geometric patterns representing government/federal architecture
3. Gradient mesh in shades of green (#00A67E) transitioning to dark backgrounds
4. Clean, modern typography integration if needed
5. Minimalist representation of performance metrics or charts

Style Guidelines:
- Ultra-minimalist, similar to Apple's product pages
- Use of negative space and subtle gradients
- Monochromatic with accent green (#00A67E)
- Soft shadows and depth without being heavy
- Abstract rather than literal representations
- Premium, professional feel
- Dark mode primary with light mode consideration

Dimensions:
- 2880x1200px for retina displays
- 16:9 aspect ratio
- Optimized for web performance

Color Palette:
- Primary: #00A67E (Accent Green)
- Background Dark: #101010
- Background Component: #1C1C1C
- Text Primary: #EAEAEA
- Text Secondary: #999999
- Border Subtle: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)

Mood/Feeling:
- Cutting-edge technology
- Government/federal authority
- Trust and reliability
- Performance and precision
- Innovation in GovCon space

Prompt for AI Image Generation:
"Create a minimalist hero image for a government AI benchmarking platform. Abstract visualization of neural networks and data flows in dark mode (#101010 background) with subtle green accents (#00A67E). Ultra-clean Apple-style design with geometric patterns suggesting federal architecture. Gradient mesh effects, generous negative space, soft depth. No text, purely abstract and sophisticated. 2880x1200px, 16:9 ratio. Premium tech aesthetic meets government authority."
