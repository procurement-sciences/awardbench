# Awarded AI Evaluation Framework

## AwardBench: The GovCon AI Performance Standard

### Executive Summary

AwardBench is a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to measure and benchmark AI systems' performance across all critical dimensions of government contracting assistance. This framework provides credible, academic-grade benchmarks for evaluating AI systems in the GovCon vertical.

### Conflict of Interest Disclosure

**IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE**: This evaluation framework and benchmark are developed by Procurement Sciences Inc., which also develops the Awarded AI Platform - one of the systems being evaluated. This represents a significant conflict of interest that must be acknowledged in all presentations of results. Independent validation by third parties is strongly recommended before making any procurement or business decisions based on these results.

### Development Status and Known Limitations

This framework is currently **IN PROGRESS** with several areas requiring additional development:

**Current Status:**

- Core evaluation pillars defined ✓
- Initial dataset collection methodology outlined ✓
- LangSmith integration framework established ✓
- Baseline evaluation pipeline implemented ✓

**Areas of Focus and Known Limitations:**

- **Data Curation (IN PROGRESS)**: Methodology for ensuring dataset quality, removing bias, and preventing overfitting needs further development
- **Inter-Annotator Agreement**: Human evaluation protocols require validation with multiple independent annotators
- **Metric Validation**: Mathematical rigor of scoring functions needs peer review and statistical validation
- **Baseline Establishment**: Need independent validation of performance claims through third-party evaluation
- **Reproducibility**: Full methodology documentation for independent replication is incomplete

   - Mathematical definitions with statistical justification
   - Sensitivity analysis for metric weights and parameters
   - Independent validation of scoring functions
   - Confidence intervals and statistical significance testing

3. **Reproducibility Standards (IN PROGRESS)**

   - Complete code and data availability for replication
   - Version-controlled datasets with timestamps
   - Deterministic evaluation protocols
   - Third-party evaluation validation

4. **Bias Prevention (IN PROGRESS)**
   - Independent evaluation by non-conflicted parties
   - Blind evaluation protocols where possible
   - Test set isolation from training data
   - Regular audits by external experts

### Success Metrics
