## Communication Templates

### For Internal Use

"We are conducting a comprehensive review of our evaluation framework to ensure it meets the highest standards of scientific rigor. While we believe the core approach is sound, we are implementing additional validation steps and transparency measures before making any public claims about comparative performance."

### For External Use

"AwardBench is currently in development and represents preliminary work toward establishing domain-specific evaluation standards. We are committed to transparency and scientific rigor, and are working with independent experts to validate our methodology before drawing conclusions about system performance."

### For Academic/Research Context

"This work represents early-stage research in domain-specific AI evaluation. We acknowledge significant methodological limitations and strongly encourage independent validation before adoption. We welcome collaboration with the research community to develop rigorous evaluation standards for specialized domains."

## Escalation Procedures

### If Asked About Current Claims

1. Acknowledge limitations immediately and transparently
2. Refer to conflict of interest disclosure
3. Emphasize preliminary nature of all results
4. Direct to roadmap for independent validation

### If Questioned About Scientific Validity

1. Agree that current methodology has limitations
2. Outline specific steps being taken for improvement
3. Commit to timeline for independent validation
4. Invite collaboration on methodology improvement

### If Challenged on Ethics/Conflicts

1. Acknowledge conflict of interest fully
2. Explain transparency and remediation measures
3. Demonstrate commitment to independent validation
4. Provide timeline for third-party review
