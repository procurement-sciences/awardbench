# AwardBench - Executive Summary

## ⚠️ Critical Disclaimers

**CONFLICT OF INTEREST**: This evaluation framework is developed by Procurement Sciences Inc., which also develops the Awarded AI Platform evaluated in this benchmark. This represents a significant conflict of interest. Independent validation is required before using these results for any business or procurement decisions.

**DEVELOPMENT STATUS**: This framework is currently **IN PROGRESS** and experimental. Key components require further development, peer review, and independent validation.

- Multi-document synthesis

### 5. Multi-Model Intelligence (MMI)

Evaluates intelligent model selection and orchestration:

- Model routing accuracy
- Cost optimization
- Fallback handling
- Quality consistency

## Preliminary Results Summary (REQUIRES INDEPENDENT VALIDATION)

**⚠️ WARNING**: These results are preliminary and potentially biased due to the conflict of interest noted above. Independent third-party validation is required before any conclusions can be drawn.

### Methodology Concerns (IN PROGRESS)

- Dataset curation methodology under development
- Metric validation incomplete
- No independent verification of claims
- Statistical significance testing not performed
- Potential training data contamination not ruled out

### Preliminary Leaderboard (UNVALIDATED)

| Rank | Model                   | Overall Score\* | Status                            |
| ---- | ----------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Awarded AI Platform** | 94.7%\*         | ⚠️ Developed by same organization |
| 2    | Claude 3.7 Sonnet       | 88.3%\*         | Requires independent validation   |
| 3    | GPT-4o                  | 87.2%\*         | Requires independent validation   |
| 4    | Gemini 1.5 Pro          | 86.0%\*         | Requires independent validation   |
| 5    | Generic ChatGPT         | 72.4%\*         | Requires independent validation   |

\*Results are preliminary and unvalidated

### Areas Requiring Development

1. **Data Quality Assurance (IN PROGRESS)**: Need rigorous dataset validation and bias analysis
2. **Metric Justification (IN PROGRESS)**: Mathematical rigor and statistical validation required
3. **Independent Evaluation (PENDING)**: Third-party validation essential for credibility
4. **Reproducibility (IN PROGRESS)**: Full methodology documentation needed
