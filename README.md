### 2. New Design System

Based on the OpenAI BrowseComp design analysis:

  - Flat design with functional focus

## Setup

### Frontend

1. Open `index-new.html` in a browser
2. The dashboard loads with sample data

### Backend (for paper generation)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python paper_api.py
```

### LaTeX Requirements

For PDF generation, install:

- TeX distribution (MacTeX, TeX Live, or MiKTeX)
- `pdflatex` command available in PATH

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/paper/generate` - Generate paper files
- `GET /api/paper/download/<format>` - Download paper (tex/pdf/bundle)
- `GET /api/paper/status` - Check generation status

## Design Principles

Following Apple/OpenAI aesthetics:

1. **Minimalism**: Every element serves a purpose
2. **Typography First**: Strong type hierarchy drives the design
3. **Generous Space**: Dark space creates focus and premium feel
4. **Subtle Interactions**: Smooth, purposeful animations
5. **High Contrast**: Clear readability with limited color palette
